For pose prediction, we use the tool FlexS.
FlexS is a tool for predicting ligand superpositions. 
For a given pair of ligands, FlexS predicts the conformation and orientation of one of the ligands relative to the other one.
FlexS is based on sophisticated physico-chemical models. In FlexS the reference-ligand is assumed to be rigid, 
thus, it should be given in a conformation which is similar to the bound state. 
The MIMUMBA torsion angle database is used for the creation of conformers, an interaction geometry database is used to exactly describe intermolecular interaction patterns. 
For scoring, the BÃ¶hm function (with minor adaptions necessary for docking) is applied.
Instead of calculating a docking, FlexS determines the similarity between the test and the reference structure by aligning them. 
This ensures that the search is limited to low-energy structures improving the quality of the results in a given amount of computing time.
