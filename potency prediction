Structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs) play an important role in drug discovery projects.
However, it is still a challenge to accurately predict the binding affinity of an arbitrary molecule binds to a drug target and prioritize top ligands from an SBVS.
We developed a novel method, using ligand-residue interaction profiles (IPs) to construct machine learning (ML)-based prediction models, to improve the screening performance in SBVSs. 
Such a kind of the prediction model is called an IP scoring function (IP-SF). 
For the potency prediction sub_challenge,
the IP-SFs employing a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm in conjunction with the FlexS (for pose generation) + MIN + GB simulation protocol to predict pIC50 values for Sars Cov2 Mpro and Mers Cov Mpro.
