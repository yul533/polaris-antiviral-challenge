Physicochemical properties:
To enhance our understanding of the ADMET profiles of antiviral agents, our study employed a multi-faceted computational approach to generate and analyze molecular descriptors. 
Initially, we utilized meta-learning techniques to compute molecular descriptors for antiviral small molecules. 
This approach leveraged the pretrained Attentive FP models—an attentive graph deep learning methodology—distinguished by their minimal root-mean-square error (RMSE) across established physical chemistry benchmarks, including ESOL (water solubility), FreeSolv (solvation free energy), and Lipop (lipophilicity). 
These pretrained model generated 10-20 embeddings that enriched our dataset and augment feature related to the physicochemical properties. (logP, logD, free solvation energy etc.) 
Due to the limited diversity of the antiviral ligands and suboptimal cross-validation results, we refrained from further fine-tuning of the Attentive FP models. And the cross-validation performance is undesirable when attempting to direct train an Attentive FP model for antiviral ligands.
Meanwhile, we also supplement a variety of relevant physicochemical properties predicted by ADMET Inc. v12, a commercial software. 
We then developed  the molecular features related to physicochemical properties, for example, ['HLM', 'KSOL', 'LogD', 'MDR1-MDCKII', 'MLM', 'Molecule Name', 'Dataset',  'cano_smiles', 'lipop_1', 'lipop_2', 'lipop_3', 'lipop_4', 'lipop_5', 'lipop_6', 'lipop_7', 'lipop_8', 'lipop_9', 'lipop_10', 'free_solv_1', 'free_solv_2', 'free_solv_3', 'free_solv_4', 'free_solv_5', 'free_solv_6', 'free_solv_7', 'free_solv_8', 'free_solv_9', 'free_solv_10', 'esol_1', 'esol_2', 'esol_3', 'esol_4', 'esol_5', 'esol_6', 'esol_7', 'esol_8', 'esol_9', 'esol_10', 'AP_FWeight', 'DiffCoef', 'MlogP', 'S+logP', 'S+logD', 'S+MDCK', 'logHLC', 'S+Peff', 'S+Sw', 'S+S_Intrins', 'S+MDCK-LE', 'S+S_pH', 'S+FaSSGF', 'S+FaSSIF', 'S+FeSSIF']
In a novel computational strategy, we dissected the antiviral molecules to identify and rank significant molecular fragments. 
This analysis facilitated the development of a binary fingerprint descriptor that captures the essence of the antiviral activity observed. 
By employing this fingerprint-based descriptor, along with the extensive list of physicochemical properties, we trained multiple machine learning models. 
This process allowed us to meticulously assess the regression fitness and select the model that best predicts the ADMET characteristics of the antiviral agents.

Metabolism properties:
Similar to physicochemical properties, we applied Attentive FP models to generate 30 embeddings for each property (HLM and HLM). 
For MLM predictions, we also included 84 compound segment fingerprints. 
Compounds were fragmented into segments based on rotatable bonds, and segments commonly found in compounds with higher property values were identified and selected as fingerprints.
